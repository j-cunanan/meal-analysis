# meal-analysis
 We have about 1,300 meal records of 60 persons in the spreadsheet provided. Each row indicates 1 meal with several features like person profile, number of dishes, detail nutrients like amount of energy, carbo, fat, protein and so on. You can see the score of each meal at the last "R" column. The score is from 1 to 4 and 1 indicates the worst and 4 does the best meal.

# GOAL
By using values from “B” to “Q” columns as input features and "R" as target variable, create a classifier to **predict the score of meal.** You can choose whichever features you like and can create any features from original ones to build the classifier.

You can find the detailed explanation of each column in the sheet named “Explanation of columns”. Columns from “C” to “J” are related to user profile and target amount of nutrients that a user should take per day.
